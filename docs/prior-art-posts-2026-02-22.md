Title:
Architecture concept: FPGA bridge giving 600GB DDR5 as GPU VRAM - open hardware Prior Art

Body:
We're designing a custom PCB cluster where FPGA chips act as protocol translators between GDDR6X (GPU side) and DDR5 (server RAM).
Result: 600GB+ effective VRAM per GPU at ~$0.56/GB vs NVIDIA's $375/GB.
